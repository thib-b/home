introduction: |
   I've made the choice _not_ to split the different things I do into separate, audience-tailored window-fronts for the art, tech, or business worlds and instead let myself cultivate this little virtual allotment.

   Navigation to your left will lead you to portfolio-style content: [CV](/cv), [Music](/music), [Photography](/photo), [Art](/art).

   Below are blog posts, thoughts, opinions, resources, you know the drill.

   [About](/about) page has a bit more about myself and licenses/credits.

   Anyway, here's music featuring yours truly, enjoy!
