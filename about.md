Hi! 

Welcome to your Thibault one-stop-shop. I've been fortunate to grow careers in tech and cybersecurity as well as music and other artistic experiments.
This page is about showing some of my work in these different worlds, sharing important work of others regardless of their field, and hosting future projects I am working on, be they software, art, or both.

I'm passionate about neuroscience, engineering and art, buzzing with ideas big and small. If psychometric tests are meaningful to you, according to [High5](https://high5test.com/) I'm a Chameleon/Philomath/Believer/Thinker/Empathizer (Gallup StrenghtsFinder broadly agrees, with less exciting terminology).

Feel free to get in touch, my contact and socials are to your left in the navigation bar.

That's all folks! Roll the credits.
